#This GUI provides users with precise predictions of flexural strength and failure mode 
for FRP-strengthened reinforced concrete beams. 
Users simply input the required parameters as prompted on the interface to 
obtain the flexural strength or failure mode prediction.
Importantly, users can base their flexural strength predictions on the predicted failure mode provided by the interface. 
Additionally, the GUI offers access to the complete database on which this model is trained.
